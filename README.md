# personalized-Workout-Recommender

 A personalized workout recommender system is based on user input. Users describe their day and select a time of day (morning, afternoon, evening). Based on this, the system suggests suitable workouts. The project uses Hugging Face’s sentiment analysis to classify the input text and a DataFrame to store possible workout suggestions.
